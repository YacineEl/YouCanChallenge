weekly_active_users query: 

    -> Original Query: 
        . DATE_TRUNC('week', e.timestamp) in SELECT, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY. 
            - This just a repeated recalculation

    -> Implemented Optimization: 
        . Using CTEs to avoid the recalculation

revenue_per_category query:

    -> Original Query:
        . Where condition after the join, we will do a join on all the rows even when we are only interested in the ones with [event_type = 'purchased']
        . We only need the product_id from the table events to perform the join, not all the rows of the table

    -> Implemented Optimization:
        . Created a purchased_events CTE that filters events before joining and choosing only the column we need from the table events [product_id]
